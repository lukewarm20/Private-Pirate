# Private-Pirate
This system is used to make your files (or other files) be sent to you privately and securely
what is desired:
to have an anonymous system where the call going to a system full of files is encrypted from anyone else reading it. When you call it, it gives you some options for what files you want, in this scenario: "press 1 for movies, press 2 for music" and so on. It then would ask for the item number, so the idea for that is it would be printed out to a good source for spreading info around reddit.com/r/piracy the file would be a pdf much like a menu for info, complete with the phone number.
When you type the item number, the bot will then tell you either that the number is invalid, or tell you what the file is called (example: 'That number is invalid, please type a valid number again." or: "Valid entry, (movie.mp4) is this correct? Press one for yes, 2 for no" Then it just returns you to the main menu if you say no. After you say yes, you then type in using the 1-9 number pad to type in your email address for it to send the file. (a movie in this case) The file is then copied, encrypted with AES256, then is sent to your email address. The email used for sending the files would be using the lava-bit accounts. Then when the email is sent, the phone number conversation will then continue to say, "The decryption key is XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX" It will repeat itself until the caller hangs up.


Another way of having the information travel over sound waves, now it is unlikely that it could actually be quick for all of the ones and zeros. But it would be an interesting approach to having the file be transfered. It would need to hooked up to a computer that could interpret the sound changes very quickly. Especially because computers can have the phone call on them or the physical phone can send it to the computer to be interpreted, whatsapp is a great example.

The automation system would work by calling up the registry of what files are available.
